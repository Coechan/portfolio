                        <p>This was my very first project! As a challange to put our new brand knowledge on <em class="languajes">HTML, CSS and JS</em>, they ask us to create and encrypter. I can assure you that it was a challange, its hard to start something from zero. It also made my feel super proud when it was finish. You can see, that it works but its not very *attractive to the eyes*. I am not a graphic designer, so I dont know much about colors, fonts, layouts and those kinds of things. But, I learn to use some pages to help me out with that.</p>

                        <p>This was my second challange, I remember that I was the entirely weekend working on in. Have I already told you that I`m persistent and hardworking when I`m motivated? well, this was the case. The task was to program the game "The hangman" were you have a few chances to guess a random word. As I said before in the section <a class="section-link" href="./index.html">About me</a>, I`m a big fan of the japanese culture, and I really enjoy reading manga. So I did my version of the hangman, using animes as random words. And I named it "The Hangoutaku". I find out that, it was going to be a more enjoyable process if I mixed the challenge with something I`m really passionate for. Also, I was super proud to share it with my friends and family memebers that also enjoy manga and anime.</p>
                        <p>In this project, I also tried my best with my designs skills. As you can see (i hope so), you`ll find a better styling that my <a class="section-link" href="https://coechan.github.io/challenge-encriptado/" target="_blank">previous project</a>. In every project i work, i expect myself to overpass my previous skills. I feel that I did that (I hope you feel that too) </p>

                        <p>The third challenge on the Oracle one program was...yay! you guess! making this portfolio. In this moment, I`m coding it, so I dont have much to tell you about this one yet. I have a few ideas, I will have to do a little research to see if i can make them come true. But...I`ll try to do my best (yep, again) and make a very me portfolio. I will leave this mini post here to the prosperity, and for me, to check my progress.</p>
                        <p>The idea of this challenge, it's to have a webpage to introduce ourselfs to this coding word and to show our projects.But if you prefer, you can also check my  <a class="section-link" href="https://github.com/Coechan" alt="github account" target="_blank">Github</a></p>

                        <p>Just a simple webpage, to present ourself to the rest of the class and, to put into practice a few Html, Css concepts that we saw on class. In this case, I feel I overdone it with the styling. But, in my defense I wanted to try lots of things, and wel.. it was too much. but, I kind like it, so I leave it that way. I also had to use Bootstrap, so I added a carousell to show some embroidery commisions that i was working on.</p>
