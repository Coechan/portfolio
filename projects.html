                            <p>This was my very first project! As a challange to put our new brand knowledge on HTML, CSS and JS, they ask us to create and encrypter. I can assure you that it was a challange, its hard to start something from zero. It also made my feel super proud when it was finish. You can see, that it works but its not very *attractive to the eyes*. 
                            I am not a graphic designer, so I dont know much about colors, typography and those kinds of things. But, i learn to use some pages to help me out with thats stuff.

                            <h4 class="section-subtitle">The Hangoutaku</h4>
                            <p>This was my second challange, I remember that I was the entirely weekend working on in. Have I already told you that I`m persistent and hardworking when I`m motivated? well, this was the case. This challenge brought the best of me (well, maybe im exagerating). The task was to program the game "The hangman" were you have a few chances to guess a random word. As I said before in the seccion <a href="./index.html">About me</a>, I`m a big fan of the japanese culture, and I really enjoy reading manga. So I did my version of the hangman, using animes as random words. And I named it "The Hangoutaku". I find out that, it was going to be a more enjoyable process if I mixed the challenge with something I`m really passionate for. Also, I was super proud to share it with my friends and family memebers that also enjoy manga and anime.</p>
                            <p>In this project, I also tried my best with my designs skills. As you can see (i hope so), you`ll find a better styling that my <a href="https://coechan.github.io/challenge-encriptado/" target="_blank">previous project</a>. In every project i work, i expect myself to overpass my previous skills. I feel that I did that (I hope you feel that too) </p>

                            <p>The third challenge on the Oracle one program was...yay! you guess! making this portfolio. In this moment, I`m coding it, so I dont have much to tell you about this one yet. I have a few ideas, I will have to do a little research to see if i can make them come true. But...I`ll try to do my best (yep, again) and make a very me portfolio. I will leave this mini post here to the prosperity, and for me, to check my progress.</p>
                            <p>The idea of this challenge, as the program call it, its to have a web page to introduce ourselfs to this coding word and to show our projects. Whitch it seems very usefull, cause off course we have github and the repository to show our projects, but this showing our coding, in the coding.</p>

                        <p>This was like a mini portfolio, to put in practice a few Html, Css concepts that we saw on class. In this case, I feel i overdone it with the styling. But, in my defense I wanted to try lots of things, and wel.. it was too much. but, I kind like it, so I leave it that way. I also had to use Bootstrap, so i added a carousell to show some embroidery commisions that i was working on. I was ask to do a web page about anything, so i did a web page introducing myself, i leaving some space to implement more ideas later. </p>
